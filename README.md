# Enterprise-Intune-Enrollment-Project
A complete solution to migrate 180+ unmanaged devices (Windows &amp; macOS) into Microsoft Intune using automation, compatibility checks, and leadership-focused communications.

## Problem
The client needed to enroll over 2,000 user devices across 11 subsidiaries into Microsoft Intune. While most devices were successfully onboarded, more than 180 remained unaccounted for and could not be enrolled remotely. The affected users were primarily remote, non-technical, and often unaware of IT compliance requirements. Manual enrollment was slow, error-prone, and unsustainable, further complicated by inconsistent leadership buy-in. 

## Solution
- Automated device compatibility scans (PowerShell + Bash).
- Enrollment scripts for both Windows & Mac.
- Built Power BI + JIRA dashboards for real-time enrollment tracking.
- Developed a communication playbook for leadership buy-in and user engagement.
- Reduced rollout time by 3 months and cut IT workload by 90%.

## Implementation
- Scripts (/scripts) with inline documentation.
- Sample dashboards (/dashboards).
- Playbooks & comms templates (/docs).

## Results
- 200+ devices enrolled securely.
- 90% reduction in support tickets related to enrollment.
- Cross-department adoption of automation for future IT projects.

## Lessons Learned
- Leadership buy-in was just as critical as technical execution.
- Training materials must be mobile-first for younger workforce adoption.
